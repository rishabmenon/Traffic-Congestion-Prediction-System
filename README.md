# Traffic Congestion Prediction System using Data Mining


## Abstract:

Due to urbanization, there is a rapid growth in number of vehicles on the road resulting in traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a condition of a segment in the road network where the traffic demand is greater than the available road capacity. In this project, we design a traffic congestion prediction system using data mining so that based on the historic traffic data, it predicts the traffic congestion values for the required locations on a particular day and time interval. This system will be useful for the traffic department officials to plan the control over traffic density on the roads.
