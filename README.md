# Traffic Congestion Prediction System using Data Mining


## Abstract:

Due to urbanization, there is a rapid growth in number of vehicles on the road resulting in traffic congestion. Traffic congestion is a condition of a segment in the road network where the traffic demand is greater than the available road capacity. In this project, we design a traffic congestion prediction system using data mining so that based on the historic traffic data, it predicts the traffic congestion values for the required locations on a particular day and time interval. This system will be useful for the traffic department officials to plan the control over traffic density on the roads. 

## Problem Statement:

This project is intended to solve following problems:

*	Train a traffic prediction model and use it to forecast traffic.
*	Design the prediction system based on big data, so that it is scalable. 

The problem of traffic congestion prediction has to solve considering both the spatial and the temporal correlations. To make the system highly scalable, Hadoop platform is used to process the big datasets.
